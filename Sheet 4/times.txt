Conclusion: 
Almost always global lock takes a bit more time than drawer lock, 
but all in all time of the different methods differ only with couple of milliseconds
which might be caused by the inaccuracy of the clock() function
so we can assume time is more or less same for every method;
(First method being the biggest might be cause because of reasons which aren't related to out problems)
